<h2>The problem Quiz Down solves</h2>


Quiz Down is an educational app that aims to make learning more fun and provides a platform for the user to test their 
wits. Quiz Down uses the Open Trivia API which is an almost unending collection of questions on topics ranging from
General Knowledge to anime and manga. The option to change the difficulty of the questions makes for a more tailored and challenging experience.
